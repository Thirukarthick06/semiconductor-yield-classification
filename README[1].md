# Capstone 2 - Semiconductor Pass/Fail Classification

This repository contains code and a Jupyter notebook template to reproduce the Capstone project:
- `signal-data.csv` : place your dataset in the repo root (you said you'll include it)
- `notebook.ipynb` : a notebook template with EDA, preprocessing, model training steps
- `train_model.py` : helper script to train and save the best model
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies
- `README.md` : this file

Instructions:
1. Clone repo and put `signal-data.csv` in the root.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or:
   ```
   python train_model.py --data signal-data.csv --out best_model.pkl
   ```
