Conclusion
The semiconductor pass/fail classification project successfully built a predictive pipeline to determine yield quality using sensor signal data.
Key achievements:

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, balancing classes with SMOTE, scaling features, and reducing dimensionality with PCA.

Three models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes) were trained and tuned using GridSearchCV.

The final selected model provided the best accuracy on unseen test data, showing that a subset of engineered features can effectively predict process yield.

This approach can help process engineers identify critical signals impacting yield, improving throughput, reducing time to decision, and lowering per-unit costs.

Improvisation & Future Work
Feature Importance Analysis – Extend the project to rank sensor signals by importance and interpret the top contributors to yield.

Model Explainability – Use SHAP or LIME to provide interpretable insights to engineers.

Incremental Learning – Implement online learning to continuously update the model with new production data.

Deployment – Wrap the trained model in a Flask/FastAPI service for real-time yield prediction in manufacturing.

Visualization Dashboard – Integrate with a dashboard (e.g., Streamlit, Dash) for interactive data exploration and prediction monitoring.
